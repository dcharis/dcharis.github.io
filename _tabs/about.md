I am a PhD researcher working in the field of **visual perception** for **legged robots**.

My work focuses on designing and implementing high-performance C++ algorithms for perception, optimized for embedded and edge platforms (NVIDIA Jetson). I am particularly interested in applied research at the intersection of computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems.

I hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from NTUA. I also have prior industry and research experience as a computer vision engineer and as a machine learning researcher in vision and remote sensing.
